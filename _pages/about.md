I’m a ScM Student in Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University. My current research focus on developing statistical models for meta-analysis. Under the guidance of Dr. Jessie Tong and Dr. Lifeng Lin, I am concentrating on IPD meta-regression methods and addressing publication bias. Additionally, my work also involves the epidemiologic analysis of musculoskeletal diseases, under the guidance of Dr. Guoqi Cai.


Outside of academia, I’m a dead hard fan of Juventus and Park Hyatt.
